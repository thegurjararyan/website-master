# Security Implementation Details

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the website to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## 1. CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection has been implemented across all forms:

- Each form now includes a unique CSRF token generated on page load
- Tokens are validated on form submission
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- Invalid tokens result in request rejection

Implementation files:
- `includes/security.php` - Contains CSRF token generation and validation functions
- All form PHP files now include CSRF token fields:
  - `forms/business-idea.php`
  - `forms/freepass.php`
  - `forms/join-community.php`
  - `forms/stall-book.php`
  - `forms/stage-performance.php`
  - `forms/volunteering.php`
- All form processing files verify the CSRF token:
  - `forms/process_business_form.php`
  - `forms/process_freepass_form.php`
  - `forms/process_join_form.php`
  - `forms/process_performance_form.php`
  - `forms/process_stall_form.php`
  - `forms/process_volunteer_form.php`

## 2. Enhanced File Upload Security

File upload security has been significantly improved:

- Strict file type validation using both MIME type and extension
- Secure random filename generation to prevent path traversal attacks
- File size limits enforced
- Proper file permissions set after upload
- Comprehensive error handling

Implementation files:
- `includes/security.php` - Contains the `secureFileUpload()` function
- `forms/process_business_form.php` - Uses the secure upload function

## 3. HTTP Security Headers

Security headers have been added to protect against various attacks:

- Content-Security-Policy (CSP) - Controls which resources can be loaded
- X-Frame-Options - Prevents clickjacking
- X-Content-Type-Options - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- X-XSS-Protection - Enables browser XSS protection
- Referrer-Policy - Controls referrer information
- Permissions-Policy - Restricts browser features

Implementation files:
- `includes/security.php` - Contains the `setSecurityHeaders()` function
- All PHP files call this function at the beginning

## 4. Database Credentials Protection

Database credentials have been moved to a separate configuration file:

- Credentials are no longer hardcoded in PHP files
- Configuration file is included from PHP files
- Consistent database connection parameters across all files

Implementation files:
- `includes/config.php` - Contains database configuration

## 5. Input Sanitization

Consistent input sanitization has been implemented:

- All user inputs are sanitized before processing
- HTML special characters are escaped to prevent XSS
- Whitespace is trimmed
- Backslashes are stripped

Implementation files:
- `includes/security.php` - Contains the `sanitizeInput()` function
- All form processing files use this function

## 6. Rate Limiting

Basic rate limiting has been implemented to prevent abuse:

- Limits the number of form submissions per IP address
- Configurable time window and maximum attempts
- Returns 429 Too Many Requests when limit is exceeded

Implementation files:
- `includes/security.php` - Contains the `checkRateLimit()` function
- Form processing files call this function before processing submissions

## 7. Secure Session Management

Improved session security:

- HTTP-only cookies to prevent JavaScript access
- SameSite cookie attribute to prevent CSRF
- Session timeout implementation

Implementation files:
- `includes/security.php` - Contains session configuration in the CSRF functions

## Next Steps for Further Security Improvements

1. **HTTPS Implementation**
   - Obtain and install an SSL certificate
   - Configure the server to redirect HTTP to HTTPS
   - Update internal links to use HTTPS

2. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Implement 2FA for administrative access
   - Use time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)

3. **Content Security Policy Refinement**
   - Further restrict allowed sources in the CSP header
   - Implement report-uri to monitor CSP violations

4. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Set up automated vulnerability scanning
   - Conduct periodic code reviews focused on security
   - Keep all dependencies updated

5. **Web Application Firewall**
   - Implement a WAF to provide additional protection
   - Configure rules to block common attack patterns

6. **Error Logging and Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive error logging
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
   - Regularly review logs for security issues
